title: "A robust SNP barcode for typing Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2014-09-01-snp-barcode
excerpt: 'Here I proposed the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to accurately genotype and discriminate all lineages and sub-lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), applying phylogenetic and population genetics methods to a collection of more than 1,500 genomes. This new system has become the preferred, most adopted and cited system in the field for MTBC genotyping.'
