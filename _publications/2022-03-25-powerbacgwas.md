title: "PowerBacGWAS: a computational pipeline to perform power calculations for bacterial genome-wide association studies"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-03-25-powerbacgwas
excerpt: 'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to investigate the genetic basis of bacterial traits but approaches to perform power calculations for bacterial GWAS are limited. Here I implemented two alternative approaches to conduct power calculations using existing collections of bacterial genomes. I designed the analytical approach, implemented the computational pipeline (including code in Python, Docker and Nextflow) and run all in silico experiments.'
