excerpt: 'The goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of genomic sequencing to predict antibiotic resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. We developed a software tool called 'TB-Profiler' to determine antibiotic resistance directly from raw genomic sequences, which has been widely adopted and used in the field'
