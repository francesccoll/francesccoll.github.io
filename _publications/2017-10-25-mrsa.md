title: "Longitudinal genomic surveillance of MRSA in the UK reveals transmission patterns in hospitals and the community"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-10-25-mrsa.md
excerpt: 'This was a large prospective surveillance study of all MRSA-positive patients in an entire healthcare network. A total of 2282 MRSA isolates were sequenced from 1465 individuals admitted to three hospitals and multiple primary care practices. The study captured a more typical view of MRSA transmission, attributable to small and multiple clinically unrecognized outbreaks, and had important implications for infection control policy and practice. I designed the analytical approach and conducted all the genomic and epidemiological analyses to reconstructed MRSA outbreaks.'
