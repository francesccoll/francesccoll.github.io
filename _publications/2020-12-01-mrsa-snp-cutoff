excerpt: 'Here I proposed a genetic relatedness cut-off above which transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can be ruled out, in the context of prospective genomic surveillance. The methodological approaches proposed here could be applied to calculate equivalent relatedness cut-offs for other bacterial pathogens.'

Here I proposed a genetic relatedness cut-off above which transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can be ruled out, in the context of prospective genomic surveillance. The methodological approaches proposed here could be applied to calculate equivalent relatedness cut-offs for other bacterial pathogens.
