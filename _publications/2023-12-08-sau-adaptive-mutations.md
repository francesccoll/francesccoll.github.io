title: "The mutational landscape of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> during colonisation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-12-08-sau-adaptive-mutations
excerpt: 'This study provides the most comprehensive picture to date on the heterogeneity of adaptive genetic changes that occur in <i>S. aureus</i> during colonisation, revealing the importance of specific nitrogen metabolic adaption, loss of quorum sensing and antibiotic resistance for successful human colonisation. Here I analysed a dataset of 7,150 <i>S. aureus</i> colonisation isolates from 1,593 subjects and identified novel adaptive variation that warrant further characterisation.'
