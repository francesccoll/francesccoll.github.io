title: "Quantifying acquisition and transmission of <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> using genomic surveillance"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-01-01-efm-transmission
excerpt: 'This was a prospective surveillance study in haematology patients admitted to a hospital in England. We showed that carriage and environmental contamination by antibiotic resistant E. faecium was hyperendemic in this population and showed high hospital acquisition rates. We also showed that invasive E. faecium infections originated from patients’ own gut-colonizing strain. I conducted the genomic and epidemiological analyses and led the interpretation and writing of the results. The bioinformatics approaches developed could inform the future translation of <i>E. faecium</i> sequencing into routine outbreak detection and investigation.'
